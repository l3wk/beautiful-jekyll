title: Development Environment
subtitle: Preparing a basic environment to bootstrap studio development.
---

We're now ready to set up a basic environment to support our studio infrastructure development efforts. Initially, we'll be starting out with quite a simple setup to allow us to get up and running quickly, however we will continue to improve and refine this environment over time. 

# Platform

The first thing you'll need is a laptop or workstation which you can use to install and run a software development tool suite. It doesn't matter too much what OS is installed on the machine since our studio infrastructure will be virtualised, however a system running [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) would be ideal.

I'll be using a [Debian 9](https://www.debian.org) workstation, so if you're working on a different platform, you may need to follow alternative installation instructions in order to set up some of the different software packages that I refer to in these articles. I will try to make note of this where relevant.

# Tools

Our simple development environment will be comprised of two main tools, a source code control system and a suitable text editor for writing code. In this section I'll describe the choices I have made, and how I have configured each tool.

## Source Code Control

One of the most important components of any software development environment is the version control system which will be used to manage the source code and resource files created for each project. While there are currently a number of different [SCCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System) products available to choose from, I would recommend using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a free and open source version control system.

Since I've already created a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account in order to host this site, I will also make use of the same service to manage the vfx studio code that I develop throughout the course of the project. The Debian package manager also includes a command line Git client which I will use to interact with any GitHub repositories I create.

Here is an outline of the steps that I followed in order to set up my GitHub account, in case you should also wish to do the same:

 * [Create](https://github.com/join) an account with GitHub  
 * [Generate](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) a new [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) key-pair and [register](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/) the public key with GitHub
 * [Generate](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-gpg-key/) a new [GPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Privacy_Guard) key and [register](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account/) it with GitHub 
 * [Configure](https://help.github.com/articles/telling-git-about-your-gpg-key/) the Git client to use the new GPG key
 * Authorise [GNOME Seahorse](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Seahorse) to manage the Git SSH credentials when prompted

This *.gitconfig* example demonstrates how I've configured the Git client on my workstation:

```
[user]
        name = l3wk
        email = l3wk@users.noreply.github.com
        signingkey = <key id goes here> 
[push]
        default = simple
[core]
        editor = vim
[merge]
        commit = no
        ff = no
[pull]
        rebase = true
[commit]
        gpgsign = true
```

I also needed to add a *config* file to my SSH settings folder (i.e., *~/.ssh*) in order to configure my SSH client to use the correct identity when interacting with the GitHub servers:

```
host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_github
 User git
```

There are a number of other Git based services (both paid and free) available online to choose from if you wish to use something different. One excellent alternative to GitHub is [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), which provides a free, fully integrated development platform, available as a cloud hosted service, or for download and installation on a local machine (e.g., using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)).

## Editor

The other main tool that we'll need in order to begin developing some software is a text editor or [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). To start with, I'll be using [Vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)), a (powerful) console based text editor which is available through the Debian package manager. 

I've customised the default Vim editor settings to configure code indents and syntax highlighting as shown in the example *.vimrc* file below:

```
set softtabstop=4
set shiftwidth=4
set expandtab

syn on
```

The learning curve for Vim is quite steep, so you may prefer to use an alternative ([GNU nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano) might be a good place to start). There are many different free text editors available to choose from, so take some time to experiment and find the one that you feel most comfortable working with.

Later on, as we get into more serious software development work, we will look into setting up a graphical IDE (such as [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), or one of the various different products from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/)), however to start with, while we're still working on infrastructure setup, a console based text editor will be more than adequate for our needs. 

# What's next?

Now that we have a simple development environment ready to work in, we can start creating the infrastructure components we will need to host the home vfx studio. One of the first components that we're going to need is an SOE for our software to run on, so that's what we'll work on next.
