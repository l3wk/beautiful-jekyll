subtitle: Software building blocks for studio systems.

In this post we will continue our exploration of technology infrastructure for vfx and animation studios. While the primary focus of our previous article was on hardware, this time around we will be considering the foundational software services which shall act as building blocks for the higher level studio systems we plan to introduce later on.

# Components

Once again, in this section we will review some key software infrastructure components which will be commonplace in almost any post-production studio.

## SOE

One of the most fundamental software components in every vfx studio is the standard operating system and associated applications which will be installed on each machine (either physical or virtual). This platform is known within the IT industry as the Standard Operating Environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Operating_Environment">SOE</a>). 

On long-running film projects, it is important to be able to provide a stable platform and associated tool chain for artists and developers in order to maintain consistency and help to minimise risk. As such, many studios develop their SOE around the <a href="http://www.vfxplatform.com/">VFX Reference Platform</a>, which is an informal standard developed by industry in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.visualeffectssociety.com/">VES</a> Technology Committee. The reference platform defines a standard suite of low-level software libraries and supported versions.

## Core Services

These standard software services appear in almost any modern technology oriented business, and this is no different for a post-production studio.

 - *Authentication*: A centralised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a> service used to authenticate user accounts so that it is not necessary to replicate user login details to multiple machines.
 - *Name Server*: An internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">DNS</a> server which is used to provide name resolution services for each of the hosts on the internal company network so that they do not need to be referred to by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a> address.
 - *Proxy*: Outbound <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> traffic should be routed through a web proxy (and subsequently some form of security gateway) in order to provide local caching for frequently requested web content and to provide bandwith management control.
 - *Web Server*: Some of the systems used throughout the business will be web based and hence need to be hosted on a web server. The studio is also likely to have an outward facing company website, which may also be hosted locally.
 - *Communications*: Staff members will require access to standard business communication tools such as email and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">IM</a>. These services may also be integrated into automated workflows in order to issue notifications to team members in response to key pipeline events.
 - *Source Control*: A source code control system (such as <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>) will be needed to maintain the tools, scripts and configuration files created throughout the course of a project by technical directors and assistants, R&D software developers and systems engineers.

## Automated Deployments

In a studio setting there is normally a large number of software systems to deploy and maintain throughout the course of a production. Additionally, the need to be able to scale infrastructure quickly on demand means that it is prudent to make use of an automated deployment and provisioning system to streamline the installation and configuration of software packages. This automated provisioning process is often referred to as Infrastructure as Code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code">IaC</a>).

An IaC system, such as <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, allows systems engineers and developers to define what software to install and how it should be configured using declarative configuration files. These configurations are then executed by a provisioning engine in order to automatically set up the new hosts and their services. The same system can be used to configure both physical and virtualised hosts, along with networking equipment.

## Package and Environment Management

As I've mentioned before, it is very common for post production houses to build up a large suite of custom software applications, tools and scripts. Each component of this software suite is also likely to have a collection of associated configuration settings (which may differ between shows) that define the environment in which the software is to be executed. The management of such a large collection of custom tools, their associated environments, their different versions, and the interdependencies between them, can become a very complicated task relatively quickly. 

A package and configuration management system helps to manage the studio's suite of tools, and can be used to provide a stable environment with locked down software versions for those projects that are nearing their delivery deadlines (where updates other than critical bug fixes would be considered an unacceptable risk), while also allowing other projects that are still in the early stages of development to harness new software releases that have been rolled out for testing or production use by the development team. 

# Implications

Once again, let's consider the implications of these findings in relation to the home studio project. How will we apply this knowledge in order to help achieve our goals?

While it's technically possible for us to make use of any Linux distribution that complies with the requirements of the VFX Reference Platform, in reality, every studio that I've worked for has made use of <a href="https://www.centos.org/">CentOS</a> Linux, so we'll do the same thing here and work towards building up an SOE of our own based on this platform.

The core software services that we need can be added as we go along. There's a variety of choices out there which we can use to address our requirements. We'll evaluate the different options and pick the most appropriate solution as the need arises.

For our Infrastructure as Code platform, there are a number of popular alternatives to choose from. In this series of articles however, we'll be making use of <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>.

Our package and configuration management will be handled by <a href="https://github.com/nerdvegas/rez">Rez</a>, an open source integrated build, configuration and deployment system that was developed by one of my former colleagues. Rez has proven to be very popular within the industry, and is used in a number of different vfx and animation studios around the world.

# What's next?

Finally, we're at last ready to start taking our first practical steps towards the construction of our home vfx studio. In the next article, we will set up a basic development environment which we can use to start creating some initial infrastructure for the studio. 

Thanks for reading, and please stay tuned for more!
